# Documentation Sync

When making changes to the project (features, fixes, architecture, setup), **always update the relevant documentation** in the same session.

## Documents to Consider

| Document | Update when |
|----------|-------------|
| [README.md](README.md) | New features, installation changes, platform support |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | Any user-visible change (add to Unreleased) |
| [docs/CONTEXT.md](docs/CONTEXT.md) | Decisions, scope, platform status, tech stack |
| [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) | Phases, future work, project structure |
| [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) | Doc structure, quick links, current status |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | Milestones, near-term goals, vision |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Architecture, CI, services |
| [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) | Implementation overview |
| [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) | Setup steps, dependencies |
| [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Contribution workflow changes |
| [fdroid/](fdroid/) | App metadata, changelogs, store submission (see fdroid-maintenance rule) |

## Workflow

1. After implementing a change, identify which docs are affected.
2. Update them in the same session before finishing.
3. Do not leave documentation outdated.
